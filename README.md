# Focused Writing

Focused Writing is a distraction-free writing mode for Obsidian that delivers an iA Writer-like experience.

## Features
- Hide UI chrome (ribbon, tabs, status bar, file header, and sidebars)
- Typewriter-style scrolling with configurable offset
- Active sentence highlighting with dimmed surrounding text
- Text scaling with custom font and optional uniform header sizes
- Configurable maximum characters per line

## Installation
1. Create a plugin folder at `.obsidian/plugins/focused-writing/`.
2. Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` into that folder.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable “Focused Writing”.

If you publish on GitHub, you can also attach a release zip with those three files.
